#### [Taco]
His scowl serves as a stark contrast to the tender affection Edward Neverdiet's
<span class='taco' data-balloon='argument about words like "elastic" and "pliable"' data-balloon-pos='up'>supple</span> fingers shows his feline companion. Waiting
at the bus stop for the “specialist” he summoned to “court”, the self-proclaimed
king of All-Over-The-Place yells, "How dare he make the king wait?"

#### [Honey Butter]
Exhausted from pacing, he sits to stroke his cat. “Of all my feline companions,
you're my favorite Mr. Catrick Swayze,” Edward imagines running his fingers
through Catrick’s fluffy mane. Catrick is a sphynx. For the moment.

“No one loves daddy like you do. Yes you love daddy don't you?”

The residue of his altercation at Planet Fitness earlier in the day lingers. “I'm
so outraged at that gym attendant at Planet Fitness! How dare he <span class='honey-butter' data-balloon='an argument that started with a coworker talking about being
"ostracized" by the #MeToo Movement' data-balloon-pos='up'>ostracize</span> me
from my place of body worship!” he reflects.

Catrick spontaneously erupts into a Persian. Edward is delighted. He likes it
when Catrick becomes a persian. He continues muttering to Catrick, “So what if
I indulged myself a slice of pizza while reveling at myself on the thigh machine,
bloody communists.”

#### [Naelotus]
Earlier in the week Edward embarked on a VHS frenzy. He fingered and prodded
boxes packed full of video tapes until he settled on a Three's Company binge. He
determined it critical to examine what he believed to be the subtle sexual tension
between Don Knotts and Suzanne Somers. He must decode the conspiracy. It was then
he became inspired to make good on his 1991 New Year Resolution to "execute a
workout routine". The sticky note was still there on the dusty tape marked:
Wholesome Animal Sounds and Suggestive Exercise Commercials.

"I dub it Project Thick Thighs!" he celebrated then proceeded to parsimoniously
mimic, into a mirror, the salacious thigh squeezing movements of the Thighmaster
Toning System. "Practice makes perfect," he chuckled, camera in hand, Catrick
pacing in and out of the field of view. He later marked this tape: Patriot
Thighs That Will Make America Great Again. Catrick was a Siamese at the time.

Since project launch, Edward has, "been removed from the gym at least three
times," Jenny commented to Austen, the head bro at Planet Fitness. She slapped
him playfully and with a toothy grin she continued, "Why do you keep letting him
in here?" It's the kind of toothy grin that implies sex in a
public bathroom.

Austen flexed his bicep and imagined a steaming plate of corned beef hash, "He's
hilarious. Didn't you see him there at the thigh master feeding his cat nibbles
of cheese pizza? I let him stay until there is a complaint."

The bus squeals to a stop and spits out Snitch, Edward's "specialist". "It's
about time <span class='naelotus' data-balloon='conversation about a recent trip
to Paris and trying to figure out what they call their bathroom attendants' data-balloon-pos='up'>manservant</span>. You make me sit idle at your peril."

"I apologize sire! I am at the mercy of the public transportation. The driver
did not heed my pleas!" Snitch raged. The driver slams the folding door shut
and zooms away.

"Excuses!"

Snitch bows low and inquires, "Everything okay sire?"

Vigorously massaging his thighs, Edward retorts, "I am sore from my workout. I
did three sets of," he thinks of an amount of weight that might impress Snitch,
"five hundred pounds."

"Wow sire, I'm­—"

"Pray," Edward inserts waving his hand dismissively satisfied, "what did learn
from your meeting with the soothsayer?"

####[Tubal-cain]
"Behold!", Snitch ejaculated with a flourish, and a gay little bow. "The
soothsayer sayeth, and you will heed. The earth is indeed <span class='tubal-cain' data-balloon='Alabama physics department spherical elephants' data-balloon-pos='up'>
spherical</span>, not flat."

"Balderdash!", came the expected retort. "That can not be true! You'd fall off
the planet at night if that was so."

"But great he-who-shall-be-obeyed!", cries Snitch. "I only do your bidding ever
since you saved me from myself that time when I almost did that thing."

Great drops of tears fall from Snitch's face. Pleadingly, "You remember that
thing don't you? That thing I almost did."

#### [Gummiworms]
Edward slowly shifts his gaze to the left then to the right, up, down and once
around clockwise for good luck. Clearly not recalling Snitch’s plight, his voice
wavers as he hesitantly answers, “yes...?”

Relief washes over Snitch as his faith in his employer is restored stimulating
a sense of self-righteousness. Edward scratches his head visibly disturbed by
Snitch. I've got to stop hiring these discount cronies off Craigslist, he thinks.
_I tasked him to uncover the truth of the prophecy and he comes back to me with
the earth is rou­—_

Sudden realization pierces the King like an arrow through the heart. Clutching
his chest, he drops Catrick who lets out a shrill "mrrrow" in protest. His face
transitions from shock to fear to utter fury.

"Spherical! " Edward spits unable to contain his disgust. "If what this so-called
soothsayer asserts is true, who knows what's out there? Imagine the delinquents
tramping around outside my <span class='gummiworms' data-balloon='conversation
with vendor about educational products' data-balloon-pos='up'>bailiwick</span>!"
He lets out a scornful laugh. "No, I can't have that. I want to see
