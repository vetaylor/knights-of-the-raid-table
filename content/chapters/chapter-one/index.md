#### [Gospel According to Gummiworms]

69,420 women in Medellin, Colombia have vanished over the past few months. Despite
this anomaly, nearly every Paisa in the valley blames Brad for Gabriela’s
disappearance. To them, Brad Thompson is gringo scum. He admits his story is
pretty bizarre. The events of that afternoon constantly replay in his mind, even
now, as he suffers from an unfortunate case of explosive diarrhea.

---

Three weeks ago, Gabriela accompanied Brad to a local artisan festival. Brad
didn’t really care for all the kitschy novelties. It was just rows upon rows of
handwoven goods, so it was no wonder he was drawn to the tent.

In a rather odd corner of the festival, there was a mysterious tent with rich
purple velvet drapes. Being a person of color, every atom in her body told Gabriela
that something was not right about that tent.

“I don’t think we should go in there,” she protested.

“Why not? It’s the only interesting thing here. C’mon it’ll just take a minute,”
Brad assured her. She didn’t agree with him, but she reluctantly followed him
into the tent anyway.

To their surprise, it was jam-packed with peculiar erotic tapestries and sculptures.
Brad was particularly drawn to one that appeared to be a map of some imaginative
land--Latexia, according to the banner at the top. His eyes honed onto Mt. Gonzo.
_Why can’t I look away_, he thought.

“Eeeee-aahh!” Gabriela screamed as she tripped on the multi-colored braided rug
in the middle of the tent.

Her shrieks seemed to shake away the spell Brad was under. He whipped around to
see Gabriela fall on her face, but before he could attempt to help her up...she
vanished. It was the most supernatural thing Brad had ever seen. Fearing for
himself, he rushed out of the tent and all the way back to his apartment.

Back to his present-day Montezuma’s revenge. Brad is not really sure why his bowels
are so agitated. I had a pretty normal day, he reflects Most of it was spent
filming a new adult movie and a toothpaste commercial. He acts on the side to pay
for the extra semester abroad. _After filming, I stopped by the coffee shop next
to my apartment to try to talk to Sergio and then I came home._ Sergio, Gabriela’s
brother and Brad’s former friend, is on a warpath to make Brad’s life miserable
for causing his sister’s disappearance. What he doesn’t know is that Sergio
covertly mixed a couple of <span class='gummiworms' data-balloon='Grimeyfingers
was talking about a bullied kid at private school who gets revenge by putting horse
laxative in the lemonade. All the students go poop at the same time.' data-balloon-pos='up' data-balloon-length='large'>laxatives</span> into Brad’s cafe con leche. Ultimately,
leading to the “volcanus” situation he’s currently in.

_Bang, bang, bang, bang!_

A fierce pounding on his door erupts causing Brad to almost fall backwards into the toilet. He should be used to it by now. Every night Sergio or one of his friends come by to harass him. They’ve yelled for hours when he’s trying to sleep, pelted his door with rotten fruit, and spray painted graphic, admittedly impressive, caricatures of him taking various phalluses in every hole possible.

Again. _Bang, bang, bang, bang!_

The silence beyond the loud knocking leaves Brad in a state of worry. Usually, Sergio and company are pretty rambunctious when they come to torment him. Brad flushes the toilet and washes his hands—clean hands save lives—before walking over to his front door.

A third time. _Bang, bang, bang, bang!_

He looks through the peephole, expecting Sergio and his gang. To his surprise, it’s someone he’s never seen before.

#### [Gospel According to Taco]

Brad cracks open the door, making sure that he doesn't accidentally unseat the security chain uselessly tacked to the dry-wall.

"Dude, the soothsayer sent me," says the man on the other side of the door.

"What?  Who is," Brad started.

"Dude! The soothsayer sent me," interrupted the man, more insistent but now equally confused and visibly worried.

"I don't know who that is!" Brad yelled quickly, making sure he wasn't interrupted.

"Oh, well why didn't you say so!" The man proclaimed. "Man, graffiti down here sure is weird," he commented as he looked at the suggestive and explicit urban art covering the outside of Brad's apartment.

Brad slammed the door.

_Bang, bang, bang, bang!_

Brad swung open the door, ripping the poorly seated chain right out of the wall and in awkward half-angry half-afraid voice yelled "What? Who is this soothsayer? Who the hell are you?".

"Dang dude, you got some pipes on you. But your voice cracked a little," came the nonchalant, but still somehow antagonizing response. "I'm Sir Grimeyfingers. I was sent down here to investigate the disappearances, despite my persistence that I don't speak a word of spanish beyond _donde estas el bano_. And I'm only about half way certain that will get me to a Taco Bell bathroom in Texas in the event of an emergency." Sir Grimeyfingers stopped, contemplating his last experience trying to order Quesaritos, but they gave him Chalupas because no one actually speaks Taco Bell. "Anyways," he continued, "I spoke to an old Colombian lady down the street, who gave me quite the <span class='taco' data-balloon='Grimeyfingers was making sure everyone would help Gummiworms while we were sitting right there helping her, he was admonished' data-balloon-pos='up' data-balloon-length='large'>admonishing</span> for adding O to the end of every word trying to pass it off as Spanish. Her daughter butted in when she heard me say Gabriela and pointed the direction of your apartment, called you gringo, and made motions like she just found herself in a small office with a camera and a black couch."

"You want to know about Gabriela?" Brad asked, perplexed but calmed by the fact that Grimeyfingers wasn't one of Sergio's friends.

"I don't care too much about Gabriela in particular, but I do want to know what happened. May I?" Grimeyfingers motioned inside Brad's apartment.

"Only if you tell me what the hell kind of name Sir Grimeyfingers is, and who this soothsayer is," Brad said as he moves to allow Grimeyfingers through the door, hoping that this is the best way to put an end to the encounter.

#### [Gospel According to Honey Butter]

Brad motions to Grimeyfingers to have a seat on a love sofa in the room that serves as his entertaining room. After both are seated, Brad looks over at Grimeyfingers and says, "So, Grimeyfingers, tell me about this name of yours. How does one get the name Grimeyfingers?"

Grimeyfingers responds, "How I got my name is not of importance right now. What is important is what I have for you."

Grimeyfingers reached down and started to pull up his crimson colored cloth robe over his legs. Brad frantically screamed, "Stop! I'm not sure who put you up to this but I'm not into this sorta thing." Grimeyfingers reached over and put his finger over Brads lips and shushed him. "You know nothing Brad Thompson."

Grimeyfingers continues to lift his robe until it is high enough to reach into a small pocket lining his man <span class='honey-butter' data-balloon='we were talking about working out in the gym and King Edward adds to the conversation by talking about he is going to buy himself a girdle' data-balloon-pos='up' data-balloon-length='large'>girdle</span>. He slowly reaches out and places an object on the table in front of him.

Brad starts freaking out but is also intrigued by the object. After a slight pause he asked Grimeyfingers, "What is that?".

Grimeyfingers responds, "That Brad Thompson is an ...."

#### [Gospel According to Naelotus]

“...ocarina,” and places the cubic zirconia encrusted instrument next to a terracotta statuette of Chac Chel on Brad’s makeshift coffee table--a plywood rectangle held up by two cable spindles. One spindle is fat with category 5e ethernet cable. The other empty but for a dried puddle of molasses and a spattering of motor oil.

“A what?”

Grimeyfingers gestures his upward facing palm toward the instrument, “This is a very special ocarina my friend.”

Brad is unimpressed. He says, “It looks like a pregnant kazoo,” and then snaps his fingers, “or an incense burner, possibly.”

“You don’t understand the gravity of the situation. We don’t have a lot of time. The world is at stake! We need to make for Thugopolis!” Grimeyfingers screams. He considers slamming his fists on the coffee table to punctuate his exclamation but realizes it’s far too rickety to withstand the impact. He settles for his knees.

Brad squints incredulously at the ocarina. _Ocarina of It’s About Motherfuckin’ Time!_ is inscribed on the belly of the instrument. “Okay man, look, clearly you’re on drugs,” he waves both hands at Grimeyfingers, “I don’t smoke anymore.”

“Huh?”

Brad reaches for the ocarina and then immediately retreats remembering it’s previous location.  He points, “You obviously smoke weed out of that thing. Maybe even crack by the way you’ve been rambling on.”

There is a pause.

Grimeyfingers considers Brad’s appeal and retorts, “I think you are confusing it with a bubbler.”
“I’m pretty sure that’s what you just put on my coffee table.  I can smell the resin all the way over here!” Brad frustratedly shrieks.

Grimeyfingers picks up the ocarina and puts it to his lips.

Brad leaps to his feet and makes his way to the front door, “C’mon bro, I’m just a normal dude.  I don’t want any trouble.  My shift at Yar-B-Q is soon.  I’m going to have to ask you to leave.”  Brad fingers the chain lock, opens the door, and signals Grimeyfingers to leave.

“Did you just say Yar-B-Q?”

“Yes.  Now please go!”

“What is a Yar-B-Q?”

“Seriously bro? It’s a pirate themed barbecue joint, now get out of my apartment.”

“Okay, okay!” Grimeyfingers squeals. He stands up and makes for the door and stops just as he approaches Brad and says, “But before I go,” then again puts the ocarina to lips. He blows delicately into the mouthpiece.

A kaleidoscopic explosion of peacock feathers plume at the conclusion of the melody.  The feathers chaotically swim downward toward Brad’s matted chocolate brown berber carpet.  An enchanted 2018 Range Rover appears in the doorway.  Although it does not interact with the physical world, the silver and black SUV is somehow corporeal and, evidently, hot boxed.  The 20” rims asynchronously spin.

“Skrrt, skrrt,” the Range Rover booms.

Grimeyfingers and Brad are absorbed into the Range Rover and begin to careen forward, or backward, or up, or down, or sideways, neither can tell. The experience of motion is abstract. Metaphysical.  Their bodies are stretched and crunched. Buildings and people stutter into view like a spinning electrotachyscope. Everything smells of orange Fanta. Somewhere downtown Medellin a rapper hits puberty mid rhyme.

_THUNK!_  The pair abruptly stop.

Brad collapses to his knees and begins to vomit.

Grimeyfingers adjusts his jockstrap and smiles inquisitively.  He jumps and clicks his heels.  The tassels on his loafers jingle.

“What in the hell was that!” Brad yelps through a dry heave.

“That my good fellow was Thunderbone.”

Brad wipes his mouth, stands firmly erect, and demands, “What is going on!?”

“We’re at the nearest <span class='naelotus' data-balloon='Gummiworms was talking about getting letters in the mail about setting up a will and Neverdiet immediately called the funeral home about a buy one get one free casket deal' data-balloon-pos='up'>mortuary</span>. Funeraria Gomez by the looks of it,” replies Grimeyfingers. He licks his index finger, smells it, and then reaches into his girdle. He begins to rummage.

“What are you doing?!?! Why am I here?!?  My shift starts in,” Brad checks his watch, “5 minutes!”
“Any mortuary is a doorway to the Thugopolis Goodbyefrost bridge as long as you have this,” Grimeyfingers reveals a forty ounce container wrapped in a paper bag.

“How much,” Brad belches, “stuff do you have in that,” he wags his finger at Grimeyfingers’ girdle.
Grimeyfingers ignores Brad who has begun to berate him in a cacophony of consonants and vowels. He twists the cap of the forty. It hisses briefly. He fastidiously tips the container sideways, “This is for all my dead homies.”

An oval purple portal materializes.

#### [Gospel According to Tubal-cain]

Grimeyfingers grins and excitedly exclaims, "Yes! The Portal emerges!"  The Portal in its purplish watery appearance shimmers and tentatively extends tentacles as if to draw anything or item into its mysterious void.

Brad, noticing the Portal, gives a little stunned expression. "Dude, you obviously hotboxed me in that <span class='tubal-cain' data-balloon='conversation about My Strange Addiction and John Wayne Gacy' data-balloon-pos='up'>maniacal</span> cruiser of yours. I am so going to be late work. I’m tripping, and I want the heck as far as I can be from that THING there."

"Later dude," says Grimeyfingers dismissively. "Watch and learn how a real man adventures."

"Whatever," says Brad as he turns to leave the mortuary.

Grimeyfingers laughs to himself about Brad's lack of testicular fortitude to explore a new portal.	"Darn millennials,” he mutters. "Hey Brad! Thugopolis ho!".
After that last syllable Grimeyfingers sprints to the Portal. He dodges a long purple tentacle that flings out and grabs him to pull him in.
"Whatever", says Brad as he leaves flashing Grimeyfingers one half of a peace sign.

Purple everywhere.

Grimeyfingers feels as if he is being torn apart and smooshed together from every possible angle.
Then suddenly, light.

It has been about 100 years since I started my voyage to 61 Cygni. I was frozen three quarters of the time, like a fish stick in suspended animation. The rest of the time I was in simultaneous terror and boredom assisting the shipboard computer navigate the unknowns of interstellar travel. I have been living off of Mac-n-Cheese MRE's and reprocessed urine.  I cycled through the ship's entire library of 10 year's worth of archived pornography, at least 10 times. I found 61 Cygni to be a complete let down for a planet survey. No unobtainium or sexy aliens to be found anywhere. Now I have returned to Earth to find it devoid of humans. Thriving cities completely empty. It is as if the entire human race just vanished. The primary sensors tell me that there is one computer terminal functioning. The  mainframe's name is Homer and it is trying to help piece together what happened to the human race. Homer and I were in the middle of spending time in the Medical Records section trying to unlock a piece of data from the Science section, when I felt a sharp kick in the ribs.

"Hey jerk-wad. Wake up! You have the keys to the cruiser. I need to get to work."

Grimeyfingers with eyes part way open looks up from the ground to see Brad deliver another kick. The floor here is wet with forty ounce and smells vaguely of urine, formaldehyde, and watermelon. “What happened?” Brad asks.

A spooky chuckle and slow clap manifest itself, echoing off the hard walls of the mortuary.  "Nice try loser, but next time you pour a libation try something other than Natty Rush Watermelon Smash. I can see you with my goggles and with my ring control your perception. Your Portal never existed. It was only in your mind."

"Neverdiet" mutters Grimeyfingers, "He is getting in my head". Now screaming, "You will not keep from my quest. Ow!"

Brad again kicks Grimeyfingers’ prone wet body. "KEYS!"

Grimeyfingers was seconds from pulling out his blackjack from his girdle when a thought occurred to him. Brad was preparing to lean into another kick, as Grimeyfingers yelled, "Wait a minute! If it is all in my head, how did you see the portal also?”
