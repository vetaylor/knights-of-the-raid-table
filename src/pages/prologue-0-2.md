#### [Naelotus]
“This soothsayer who goes by the name Rumpleforeskin,” Edward exclaims with ire,
staring into the distance, hands massaging his gut.

“But sire­—”

“Don’t interrupt me during my particularly villainous gaze into the horizon
Snitch,” Edward interjects. He wipes the parentheses of crusted spittal from his
mouth, “Okay, you may proceed. What say you?”

“Rumpleforeskin has ventured to the realm of Latexia!” Snitch adjusts his fanny
pack and briefly thinks about the contents­—golf balls marked with a variety of
elemental spells, duck sauce packets from China One Buffet (not marked), a pouch
of crushed Smarties candy marked as Poison Dust, and a set of well worn rubber
gloves (not marked). During LARP sessions the fanny pack doubles as a Batman
Utility Belt or his wizard pouch. The golf balls sometimes do extra duty as Materia.

“So,” Edward twists the hair on his chin, “this soothsayer, I wonder the motive.
Why trek to such a dangerous realm?” Latexia is notorious amongst realm travelers.
It is home to the prematurally erupting Mt. Gonzo, a nightmarish vibrating meat
volcano. In the midwestern region dwells a garden of sexually suggestive rubber
corn-on-the-cob. The sultry kernels lure in oblivious travelers, goading them to
take a lick. When approached the ear of rubber corn emerges from the husk like a
canine penile sheath and butters the enchanted traveler to death. There is myth
of a misty graveyard packed full of forgotten dildos. Native Latexian scholars
believe these zombie dildos abruptly attack during important life-events­—marriage
consummation, open-house, attached to a quadcopter and zoomed around during a
press conference.

There is a pause. Both digest the information.

“I’ll need to use the Goodbyefrost.” Edward begins to shuffle through his pleather
briefcase. It was on sale for $9.99 from $29.99. A sale he could not pass up.
From the bag he reveals a limited-use Legendary Babushka Pickle. He begins to
expose the first pickle within the pickle.

“But sire, what about Gurkensalat?! The troll that guards the gate to Latexia?”

“Silence Snitch! I cannot concentrate while you salivate and fondle your fanny pack
simultaneously!” Edward explodes. “Clearly I will use this invisibility potion I
got from the Snacko Alchemist!” He suddenly remembers the difficulty in obtaining
the ingredients­—a cup of <span class='naelotus' data-balloon='Taco talked about this at a going away luncheon at a sushi restaurant' data-balloon-pos='up'>banana ketchup</span>, a morsel of chewed Trump
Steak, the ash of a winning lottery ticket ($5 or better), and three dead AA
batteries from a used 1995 Tickle Me Elmo.

Edward pulls apart the final pickle. Inside is a bread and butter gherkin. He
clutches it in the same manner he does pound cake or a canister of mechanical
penetrating lubricant­—lovingly.

“Don’t do it! Gurkensalat will shout highly informed anti-Republican Internet insults
to try and change your mind about human rights!” Snitch gasps for air. Edward
throws Snitch an annoyed glance, “Tshh,” and fists the air, proclaiming, “Drop it
like its hot!”

In a sparkling whoosh of bubbles, Edward disappears from “court” and is teleported
to the Latexia bridge of the Goodbyefrost; with him the invisible potion, pleather
briefcase, and indelible gusto.

#### [Tubal-cain]
Total darkness.

"What have I done?" murmurs Edward in a truly unexpected introspective moment.
There is no gravity, no sound, not even the feel of the beating of his own heart.
Edward worried that he might have a heart attack or something of that nature.
Slowly a hazy shimmer of a rainbow appears. Faint at first as if it were a great
distance away. Suddenly more clear and moving fast, as if traveling at
unimaginable speed.

As the light moves from its multispectral components to the total white of intense
searing illumination, the Latexia bridge is hurtling towards him. In a panic,
Edward flings up his arms in vain to protect his body as if touched by a
<span class='tubal-cain' data-balloon='Naelotus was talking about team building' data-balloon-pos='up'>galvanizing</span> force. He cries out.

Suddenly, he is motionless. Not like it was as he was teleporting, but standing
on firm ground. A slight noise surrounds him like the tinkle of small pebbles on
dry bamboo or maybe even a windchime made of broken glass pieces, dangling in a
slow breeze.

"First time teleporting? Or perhaps was it a tesseract?" says a creature that looks
nothing like what Edward expected a DemoRAT-pablum-puking-fake-news-spouting troll
to look like.

"You must be Gurken­—­—", Edward started to say, but a loud squeal and feline
mooing sound had formed behind him and was approaching at such a great speed he
was startled to silence. As he looked down he saw Snitch clutching Catrick Swayze
and curled into a fetal ball.

"Snitch!", growls Edward. "How dare you follow me on this quest that you have
obviously failed at achieving yourself."

"It's not my fault sire! As you were surrounded by bubbles, Catrick and myself
were swept along like a VW bug drafting behind a Mack truck."

Edward was terribly displeased. That punk tagged along to spite me and worse, he
has brought Catrick Swayze into peril.

"Meow Meow Meow Meow!", Catrick mournfully exclaims.

"I know Catrick, that must have been a terrifying trip for you. Would Catrick
like a cuddle?" says Edward in his best baby talk voice.

"It sure was," says Snitch standing up and adjusting his multiple "utility" packs.
He continues, "As Catrick and I were hurtling through the ether, all I could think
of is what my life is and what it could be. You might not know this but I really
have a thing for Jenny. I mean it is obvious that Austen is hitting it pretty much
regularly,” he jealously asides. Snitch kicks a rock that isn’t there and continues,
“And that's cool because he is pretty fly for a white guy. I just want to come up
to her sometime and let her know how I feel. I’ll worship her like I would a
pagan temple priestess."

As Edward, Catrick, and the troll try to digest these very intimate thoughts that
Snitch was dumping out of his purse, Snitch starts to make a startling sound. Quiet
at first, barely a whisper, then suddenly in his best crackly folk singer voice
he spurts out a song.

_"Guinnevere had green eyes
Like yours, mi'lady like yours
When she'd walk down
Through the garden
In the morning after it rained
Peacocks wandered aimlessly
Underneath an orange tree
Why can't she see me?
Guinnevere..."_

As Snitch is singing his heart out, the jaws of the troll, Edward, and to the best
extent that a cat can do are dropped.

Edward is the first to come to his senses, "Snitch! Nobody wants to hear about
your pathetic love life."

"That was truly pathetic," says Gurkensalat. But again, he is a troll, what else
would he say?

Snitch had a look of righteous indignation. A resolve came into his face that had
not been seen there since he was given the regular size fries instead of the biggie
size he paid for at Wendy's years ago.

"You are all A-holes!", he screams in cross between an accusation and a question.
"I love Jenny, and if I survive this quest I will walk up to her, grab her by the
hand, and I WILL take her to that bathroom. I will buy myself a big box of condoms
that I can keep on rotation in my fanny packs because you never want to get
caught with a stale jimmy-cap! One day I will seal the deal!”

"You know I normally hassle jerks like you guys that try to slip over the border
in Latexia," chuckles Gurkensalat. He steps away from the gate and gestures entry
to the entourage, "I have recently woke to the idea that borders are so early 2000's,
and besides you guys seemed to be pretty f'd up anyway. I really doubt you'll
survive long enough to cause anybody trouble here. If you are interested, I can
get an immigration advocate for you to help you along. What say ye?"


#### [Honey Butter]
Edward reluctantly replies, "I shall speak to this immigration advocate. Chop chop!”
Gurkensalat excitedly responds, "Great I shall walk you over to the immigration
office to meet Rueben McSandwich, our immigration specialist."

Edward and Snitch are seated at a table across from Rueben. After a brief exchange
of introductions, Rueben states that due to current laws, it is protocol that a
family member must be separated from Edward being that he will be an illegal immigrant
to Latexia. Thus, he must leave his companion Snitch behind. Cat protocol is 30
days quarantine in a male-only cat brothel. Rueben asks Edward, "Are you ok with this?"

Snitch bursts out "Your majesty, surely you can't consider this. I'm your most
loyal manservant."

Edward raises his hand dismissively towards Snitch. _This is perfect, I can finally
ditch this craigslist mistake and have Jenny for myself_, Edward quietly rejoices.
His eyes darts to his briefcase, remembering the invisibility potion, and over to
Catrick. He replies to Rueben, saying, "Yes! Take him away from me this minute!"

Snitch vocally protests his deportation and attempts to resist. Reuben unleashes
his <span class='honey-butter' data-balloon='this is the second word after surmise, happened during a discussion about what qualifies as a "word of the day"' data-balloon-pos='up'>flaccid</span> billy club and begins to incessantly slap Snitch directly
in the face. During the commotion, Edward snatches the invisibility potion from his
briefcase and pours it into Catrick’s mouth. Catrick spontaneously changes to an
Abyssinian and then vanishes from sight.



#### [Gummiworms]
_THWACK!_

The sound of the door bursting open reverberated through the tiny room. Four, a
porte malheur for death in Chinese culture, unnervingly virile humanoid figures
clad in black rubberized masked bodysuits storm into the room surrounding the
demoralized Snitch lying on the floor. Glancing upwards at the inky figures towering
over him, Snitch blanches, peeing a little, upon reading the bold white text across
their chests: **LICE**. _Latexia Immigration and Customs Enforcement._

“No, no, please! I­—,” he wails as Reuben procures a ball gag and restrains him.
His muffled cries echo through the room and down the hall as the LICE agents
forcefully carry him away.

Satisfied, Reuben turns to Edward smiling gingerly as he searches for the cat who
is no longer present. Frowning, he thinks to himself, _I really ought to see someone
about these cat hallucinations I keep having. I’ll deal with that later._

“Merci, Monsieur Edouard for being so patient,” Reuben opens in a sweet, southern
French accent as he returns to his seat. He gently caresses the decorative silicone
tentacle he uses as a paperweight on his desk.

“King Edward,” Neverdiet sharply retorts. Only English when addressing the king.
Reuben flamboyantly waves his hand dismissing Edwards protests. A high-pitched whoop
rings from his back pocket. He pulls out a smartphone and furiously taps on the
screen, “What brings you to Latexia? Quel est ton but?”

“Tone butt? No, I don’t exercise.” It’s common knowledge that King Neverdiet lost
his hearing stumping for Trump during a Diamond and Silk video.

Fixated on his phone, Reuben continues to ask questions which Edward continues to
aggressively answer off-target.

“Finally, monsieur,” Reuben looks up from his phone, “how do you feel about the
prevalence of existential and moral <span class='gummiworms' data-balloon='came up during a random chat about the Big Lebowski' data-balloon-pos='up'>nihilism</span> in pop culture? Do you
believe the impact of social media sparking an increase in addictive consumerism
is correlated?”

By this point, Edward tires of Reuben’s seemingly meaningless questions and propels
himself across the table. “Listen, you pathetic sausage jockey! I have urgent
business with Rumpleforeskin. Reveal her location posthaste before I hang thy
twinkly self with thy beloved tentacles!” he threatens.

A flurry of crisp whoop’s emit from Reuben’s phone. Glee immediately radiates
across his face. Nine new Grindr hook-ups. He shoves the phone in Edward’s face,
“You passed! I used your answers for my profile and chat conversations! And voilà!”

Reuben kisses his phone and Edward on both cheeks, “I’ll tell you where she is.”

#### [Taco]
Edward emerged from the LICE office bearing a massive grin. The soothsayer was
much closer than he could have hoped. Reuben informed the King that Rumpleforeskin
was in the process of leaving Latexia, a surprisingly lengthy process that came
about due to political pressure from neighboring worlds. Apparently what was
happening in Latexia wasn't staying in Latexia.

Across the square from the LICE office was the building Rumpleforeskin was in. It
was a large building with stained glass, with a large angel bearing a cross on its
high steeple. "These godless heathens would never go to church! What is this farce?"
The King’s bellowing inquiry went unanswered. He really should have listened to Reuben,
but he had no time for Frenchmen who were concerned with toned butts. Edward pondered
the situation for a moment, but in a moment of clarity and sense of purpose that
startled even himself, Edward began working towards his goal.

Edward set his briefcase on a table and opened it. Small <span class='taco' data-balloon='King Edward was talking about getting a dish at the phillipine buffet that looked like rat turds in a white sauce' data-balloon-pos='up'>chafing dishes</span>
served as organizers, separating various items and materials from one another. He
quickly located and extracted the two items he would need for the soothsayer:
Twizzlers expired exactly 767 days ago and a pair of goggles that didn't do anything
to him, but would drastically impact others. He gingerly closed and snapped shut
his briefcase, and with his tools in hand proceeded to the church.

Edward entered the church and without hesitating yelled "Rumpleforeskin!" He was
met with judgemental glares from the clergy and laughter from those waiting their
turn to leave Latexia. Much to his surprise, a LICE agent approached.

"Monsieur Reuben informed us you would be coming, so we held your rumpled foreskin
for you," the French LICE agent led Edward to the holding room, not recognizing
his Freudian slip. The agent opened the door for Edward, and then firmly closed
it after he entered.

"Rumpleforeskin!" Edward exclaimed as he finally had his quarry in hand.

"Why the hell do people keep calling me that? Who the hell are you?" The soothsayer
responded, obviously frustrated and confounded by the presence of such a strange
and boisterous man.

"I'm asking the questions here," Edward immediately responded, his calm tone
didn't last long. "Your round-earth lies have been spread too far and wide! You
will tell me..." he paused, suddenly realizing that the soothsayer was a woman
and that the name Rumpleforeskin indeed did not make any sense. He must ponder this.

"Tell you what?" The soothsayer asked. To her surprise the previously boisterous
man was now quiet as he worked. Ignoring the fuzzy handcuffs used to secure her
to the chair, Edward used the Twizzlers to function as an additional binding.
Next, he placed the goggles over the soothsayers eyes and head, her struggling
in vain as she could hardly move due to the Twizzlers tight grip on her arms.

Edward stepped back from the soothsayer, eyeing her up and down, and finally
deciding that he was pleased with his work. "Okay round-earther, you will tell
me how to undo your lies," he said, leaning in and placing his hand on the goggles.

"What lies? The Earth is round, haven't you ever used Google Earth?" She retorted,
now fully terrified by the increasingly ridiculous predicament she found herself in.

"More globalist lies!" In his rage, Edward had an epiphany. "How do I get rid of
all the liars?" Edward flipped the switch on the goggles, and watched as the
soothsayers face contorted.

In the confused agony caused by the images she now saw, the soothsayer let slip
information about multi-colored rugs working as portals. Edward’s smirk widened
to a grin; the goggles had worked and he now had a plan.
